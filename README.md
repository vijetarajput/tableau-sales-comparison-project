# Sales Comparison Dashboard â€“ Tableau Project

## Project Description

The director of a leading organisation wants to compare sales performance between two regions. Regional operators were instructed to record their sales, and upper management requires a visual dashboard to compare key metrics between the two regions and suggest areas for improvement.

This project uses Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that displays key sales KPIs for both regions.
